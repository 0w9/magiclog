# magiclog
MagicLog is a NextJS package to make logging (errors, variables, users) easy. There's many analytics tools (PostHog, GA), and error trackers (Sentry). But nothing really combines it-- except MagicLog. See context when logging all variables, create custom extensions and integrate with popular databses.
