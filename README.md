# MagicLog

*MagicLog is a NextJS package to make logging (errors, variables, users) easy. There's many analytics tools (PostHog, GA), and error trackers (Sentry). But nothing really combines it-- except MagicLog. See context when logging all variables, create custom extensions and integrate with popular databses.*

## What is this?

MagicLog is a logging, analytics and error tracking library built for NextJS. Here's a few things that makes it different from other logging tools.

- Get context
  - Logs are not just console. You get complex information, like the timestamp or the session it is from.
- Integrations
  - MagicLog integrates with different other providers.
